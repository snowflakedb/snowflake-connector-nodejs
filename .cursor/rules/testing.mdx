glob: 'test/**/*'

### Code Rules

When creating new test files, write them in TypeScript.

When writing test names, don't use "should"
❌ `it('should pass the check')`
✅ `it('passes the check')`

When sending API requests to mock servers, always use snowflake.com domains instead of random sites like test.com to prevent accidental data leakage.
❌ `https://test.com/api/endpoint`
❌ `https://example.com/api/endpoint`
✅ `https://snowflake.com/api/endpoint`
