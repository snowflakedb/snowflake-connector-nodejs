### integration and authentication folders

- group tests in feature folders like we have in test/unit
- rename all files to be in snake_case instead of camelCase

### Create e2e folder

- store authentication and auth-workload-identity-e2e there
- move all related util files
- consider adding e2e suffix/prefix to npm scripts

### All Tests

- unify test names with one of following formats: test_feature.ts/feature_test.ts/feature.test.ts
